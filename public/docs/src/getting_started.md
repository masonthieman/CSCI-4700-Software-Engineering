# Getting Started

If you are just getting started with working on this project, I can tell that you are already about to have a panic attack due to the file size; but I assure you that you have nothing to worry about since you'll only be touching 5% of the file structure. As long as you read through the documentation, you will know exactly where everything is and how to reuse and expand what we already have here. If you ever get lost with some aspect of the application, again, check for it here in the documentation.

**Note: This project follows the Lavarel conventions. Be sure to check them out before starting development**
